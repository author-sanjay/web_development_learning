            It is not the first time that people have raised  voice. People tweet a lot, revolt on social media, petitions are signed. But afterall what happens.<br/>
            People forget it with time. It is said that time canheal every wound. And that's why this crime still exits in our society.<br/>
            It is now very easy for these criminals to eacape from this damn loose system of our country. In other countries these type of criminals are hanged to death, but in out<br/>
            country it takes years and years for the justice to be delivered. Now the criminals are fearlessly roming in our society. And the women in our country are unsafe.
